The goal of the project is to develop a tetris game played with binary numbers.
General Information
This game is played in a 20*13 gaming area placing triple blocks in order to obtain a specific pattern.
Game Playing Information
At the beginning of the game, a four digit pattern is given by the player. During the game, randomly generated active triple blocks appear at the top of the game area, then starts to fall.
Player can move the active block to the left or to the right. When any part of the active block reaches the base blocks, it stops falling.
When the active block is stabilized, “pattern searching” operation is executed. This operation is done in four directions (up to down, down to up, left to right, right to left).
In pattern searching operation, if we come across the pattern in the game area, this occurence of the pattern blocks disappears and upper blocks fall down.
After the falling of upper blocks, pattern searching operation is rechecked. As long as finding the matching pattern, the same procedure is repeated.
